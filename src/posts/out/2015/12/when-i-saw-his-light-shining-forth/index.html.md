> When I saw his light shining forth,> 
> In fear I covered my eyes with my palms,> 
> Afraid for my sight because of the beauty of his form.> 
> So I was scarcely able to look at him at all.> 
> The lights from his light are drowned in his light> 
> and his faces shines out like the sun and moon in one.> 
> A spirit of light lodged in a body like the moon,> 
> a mantle made up of brilliant shining stars.> 
> I bore it until I could bear it no longer.> 
> I found the taste of patience to be like bitter aloes.> 
> I could find no remedy to bring me relief> 
> other than delighting in the sight of the one I love.> 
> Even if he had not brought any clear signs with him,> 
> the sight of him would dispense with the need for them.> 
> Muhammad is a human being but not like other human beings.> 
> Rather he is a flawless diamond and the rest of mankind is just stones.> 
> Blessings be on him so that perhaps Allah may have mercy on us> 
> on that burning Day when the Fire is roaring forth its sparks.>
