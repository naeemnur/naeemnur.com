> There are stories in your eyes.> 
> 
> I never told you how> 
> sometimes I fell asleep> 
> with the thought that you > 
> were perhaps the moon-> 
> 
> always disappearing > 
> with the dawn.> 
> 
> I would awake with > 
> nothing> 
> but the shape of you> 
> on my bed and the> 
> gloom of you on> 
> my skin.
