> 'Cause sometimes you just feel tired,> 
> Feel weak, and when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up.> 
> But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength> 
> And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up> 
> And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.
