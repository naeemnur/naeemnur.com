I love playing video games in my free time, specially indie games. Here is a list of 5 indie games i enjoyed playing in no particular order.

## Firewatch

Firewatch is developed by the guys who made the Coda editor for Mac. It is one of the stunningly beautiful game I've ever played, It has a very vast wilderness to explore and an interesting story.
