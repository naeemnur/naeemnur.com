A very nice talk by Steve Silberman, who wrote a book on the history of autism, presented it this way:

> One way to understand neurodiversity is to think in terms of human operating systems: Just because a PC is not running Windows doesn't mean that it's broken.
>
> By autistic standards, the normal human brain is easily distractible, obsessively social, and suffers from a deficit of attention to detail.
