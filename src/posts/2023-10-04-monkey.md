> Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain
> There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived
> Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
> Obscured as it was by great clouds
> Here, they played out their peaceful lives
> Innocent of the litany of excess and violence
> That was growing in the world below
> To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
> Then one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town
> They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses
> But no one noticed them, they only saw shadows
> You see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind

> Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
> Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
> Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
> Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
> The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead

> In time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain
> And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty
> By chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
> The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
> And soon they began to mine the mountain
> Its rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world
> Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly
> Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
> Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
> Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
> And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear
> Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey
> For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful
> For they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep
> And then came a sound, distant first, that grew into castrophany
> So immense that it could be heard far away in space
> There were no screams, there was no time
> The mountain called Monkey had spoken
> There was only fire, and then... nothing

> Oh, little town in the USA, your time has come to see
> There's nothing you believe you want
> But where were you when it all came down on me?
> Did you call me? No
