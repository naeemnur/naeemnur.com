**_A poem by James._**

> James, a boy trapped inside,> 
> Autism barring the door to freedom.> 
> A trickle of light streams through the lock,> 
> Blinding against the darkness.> 
> One year.> 
> Eyes adjust, and crave more rays of hope.> 
> The lock becomes brittle, but still fastened.> 
> Then the brightest illumination strikes the still dull eyes.> 
> One year.> 
> Eyes adjust to the increasing demands.> 
> Still trapped, but the door ajar.> 
> Objects outside this prison come into focus.> 
> One year.> 
> The chains disintegrate under the force of the sun.> 
> The door springs open,> 
> The lock shatters as it meets the ground.> 
> Autism pales against the light of heaven.
