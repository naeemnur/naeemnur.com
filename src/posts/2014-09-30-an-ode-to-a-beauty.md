To the girl I saw at the bus stop...

> Mesmerizing eyes; look how they gaze,> 
> Every time they send me, > 
> To an inescapable maze.> 
> 
> Charming cheeks; look how they glow, > 
> Thou art the gifted one, > 
> Of the beauty He rarely bestow.> 
> 
> Beautiful lips; look how they tantalize,> 
> Holding many sweet words, > 
> O'beauty, please vocalise. > 
> 
> Look at those ears; embellished with pearls, > 
> O'beauty, listen to my melody, > 
> Let me make you twirl.> 
> 
> **Look at that face; outdoing the moon,> 
> For its single glimpse,> 
> I will walk a thousand miles, > 
> When ever it will wear a smile..**
