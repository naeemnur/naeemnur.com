> Eighteen and jaded with guns in their hands
>
> They were fighting for freedom and just what is that?
>
> Bills to the banks and food for the kids
>
> Money for college but couldn't get in
>
> Made all the grades but got taken to task
>
> By a man in an alley wearing a mask
>
> Screamed and she begged as the people walked by
>
> The man, he just laughed and the woman she cried
>
> Well, it's time all you people, turn around
>
> For the life we've been living, messing around
>
> The blood we've been spilling will bleed us dry
>
> The life we've been killing is your life like mine
>
> The needle is sweet and the snow it is pure
>
> The pain I've been hiding from I'm finding a cure
>
> The night it is warm, well the light it is cold
>
> The family I'm loving, I'm calling them home
>
> It's time all you people, turn around
>
> For the life we've been living, messing around
>
> The blood we've been spilling will bleed us dry
>
> The life we've been killing is your life like mine
>
> My heart it is thumping, the veins they've been blue
>
> The blood that's been pumping, it still hasn't met you
>
> The beard that I'm growing, not fully grown
>
> The years are not coming the way I thought they would
>
> I'm hoping and waiting for something to sing
>
> Like the angels in heaven, the bones on the street
>
> Hoping for love to find a new voice
>
> The song that needs singing has already been sung before
>
> Well, it's time all you people, turn around
>
> For the life we've been living, messing around
>
> The blood we've been spilling will bleed us dry
>
> The life we've been killing is your life like mine
>
> Turn around
>
> For the life we've been living, messing around
>
> The blood we've been spilling will bleed us dry
>
> The life we've been killing is your life like mine
