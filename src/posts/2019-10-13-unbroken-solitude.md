> In an unbroken solitude, thoughts appear from nowhere. They frighten me.
> And, lost in the night, my thirst, my desire for water awakened me.
> Oh love, dreaming of your tale has exhausted me.
> I have no hate left for anyone; my soul is confused.
> I believe in no one now.
> Iâ€™ve become the son of gazelles,
> who grew up in the meanderings of the desert.
